      <p>
        I have professional experience as a Systems Coordinator,
         where I improved network performance, strengthened security protocols, 
         and supported critical IT infrastructure. My work involved IT asset management, troubleshooting, 
         and collaboration with technical teams to resolve complex issues efficiently.
      </p>

      <p>
        I hold a degree in Telecommunications Engineering and 
        have built a foundation in programming through academic training and software development courses. 
        I am now focused on combining my infrastructure IT background with software development skills to continue
        growing and contributing within the tech industry.
